These instruments vary greatly in size, ranging from a cubic meter to a height reaching five floors, and are built in churches, synagogues, concert halls, and homes. It consists of different compartments and compositions. The pipe organ is a musical instrument that produces sound by driving pressurized air from the keyboard into the organ pipes.</p>
            <p id="para2">This instrument contains almost every sound of all the instruments in the world. It has different keyboard compartments of either; 1 compartment, 2 compartments, 3 compartments, 4 compartments, etc. It also has pedals that serve as the bass notes when playing sheet music or when playing a normal hymn using the organ.</p>
